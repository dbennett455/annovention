This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/annovention/ that fixes bugs and
removes Apache log dependency to keep the library lightweight.

Differences compared to the original Annovention library:

* Discoverer can be specified to scan only classes, fields, or methods;
  and to scan only runtime visible or invisible annotations
* ClasspathDiscoverer has been improved to properly scan all class loaders
  (based on http://code.google.com/p/reflections)
* Apache Common Log has been removed; the only dependency is Javassist
* 2014-02-14 - dbennett455 - New listeners added that accept the Javassist
  objects for access to annotation parameters and other info.
* 2014-02-15 - dbennett455 - Added new listeners for Method Parameter
  Annotations in both the original String flavor and new Object flavor.
